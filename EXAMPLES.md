üîÑ **Consider Changes:** Your FLEX spot could be upgraded

**Waiver Wire Recommendations:**

**Your Team (127.5 proj points):**
- QB: Josh Allen vs weak NYJ defense ‚úÖ
- RB: CMC (questionable) + Saquon Barkley
- WR: Tyreek Hill + CeeDee Lamb

**Their Team (112.3 proj points):**
- QB: Joe Burrow (tough matchup vs SF)
- RB: Josh Jacobs + Tony Pollard
- WR: Davante Adams + Mike Evans

**Key Matchups:**
- Your Josh Allen vs their Joe Burrow: Advantage YOU (better matchup)
- Their Mike Evans vs your CMC: Monitor CMC's status

**Prediction:** You're favored by 15.2 points, but watch CMC's injury status closely."

### Injury Research Deep Dive

**User:** "Christian McCaffrey is questionable again. Should I start him or play it safe?"

**AI uses tools:**
- `research_player_status` ‚Üí Web search for latest news
- `get_player_details` ‚Üí Current roster status
- `get_waiver_suggestions` ‚Üí Backup options

"Here's the latest on Christian McCaffrey:

**Current Status:** Questionable with calf injury (limited practice Wednesday)

**Latest Reports:**
- ESPN: 'CMC participated in light drills but sat out contact portions'
- SF Chronicle: 'Coach Kyle Shanahan optimistic but will be game-time decision'
- Fantasy experts: 'Have Jordan Mason ready as pivot option'

**My Recommendation:**
üü° **CAUTIOUS START** - Keep CMC in lineup BUT:
- Set Jordan Mason as your backup plan
- Monitor Friday injury report
- Check inactives list 90 minutes before kickoff

**Risk Assessment:** 70% chance he plays, but could be limited if he does play"
